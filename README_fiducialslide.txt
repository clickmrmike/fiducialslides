Slide Design Notes:
We have developed a common sample slide for use across imaging platforms that includes automatically 
recognizable fiducial registration points to enable co-registration of images from different 
imaging platforms at high spatial resolution. Our goal was to develop a slide with the requisite 
fiducial registration points to meet the following criteria:
1)    Fudicials visible using standard white light, backlight, and confocal microscopy
2)    Fudicals that include large scale and small scale features
3)    Fiducials easily visible to imaging mass spectroscopy (IMS) sample alignment optics
4)    Fiducials made from materials that would not cause sample interference in optical or IMS analysis
5)    Fiducial patterns that are simple to understand and convenient to use in microscopy, 
      e.g. can be found even in small field of view alignment optics used in micron and submicron IMS
 
Design
The basic design features alphanumeric characters (size < 1mm) located around the periphery of the 
slide which can be used to specify slide location in the same manner as a common paper map.  All 
markings are located at least 1mm away from the slide edge to avoid having them obscured by 
slide holder fixtures.  Marks on multiple edges help prevent the problem of fiducial features 
that could be out of view in the small field of view present in the alignment optics of some 
commercial MS instruments.  The placement and size of all features maximize the working area 
of the slide.  Alphanumeric symbols improve the reliability of automated visual detection 
for registration such as used in our commercial automated spotters.
 
The design also features well targets with inside diameters of 200um, 300um, 400um for 
machine spotting and 1500um for hand spotting of compounds.  Symmetric location of these 
wells at the corners of the slide enable future normalization studies that include compensation 
for ion detection changes in MALDI MS that would occur across a slide or instrument stage 
that is not perfectly level. 

This design is intended to be screened on plain or ITO-coated 75mm x 25mm standard microscope 
slides. We recommend a UV-cured urethane ink for printing as it is highly opaque and 
very visible in instrument cameras and alignment optics. Slides printed by our vendor (information 
below) has been tested and is resistant to damage by all acid and solvent washes currently used 
in our IMS protocols, including hexane, EtOAc. Carnoy's fluid, xylene, tolune, DMSO, methanol, 
ethanol, isopropanol, water and acetic acid.  This ink also resists removal by plasma cleaning.
The ink-printed fudicials can be ablated by the UV laser found in most IMS systems, but 
the resulting spectra produced indicate primary fragments under 325Da. 

Notes on printing: 
As of the revision date, this design approches the resolution limits for many printing services.  
It is highly recommended that you work closely with your slide manufacturer to verify accuracy 
and legibility of printed features.
Most vendors will accept Corel Draw files for printing.  If you require this design in a different 
file format, we HIGHLY recommend careful examination of the fiducial placement after conversion. 
Many design software packages do a poor job of accurately converting graphic files.
This design is intended for use with uerethane inks.  Many vendors use proprietary inks; you will 
want to veryify with your vendor that the ink used will both withstand common IMS protocols and 
does not interfere with MS analysis in your m/z range of interest. Teflon content in the ink will 
improve the performance of the target wells for samples with low viscosity.  
Obtain test samples and experiment before committing to an expensive production run.

Vendor note:
While we do not endorse or recommend a particular vendor, we have worked closely with Scientfic 
Device Laboratories in developing these slides, and they are the current vendor for slides used 
at the National Research Resource for Imaging Mass Spectrometry here at Vanderbilt.
